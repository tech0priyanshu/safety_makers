    <p>Letâ€™s break this down step by step â€” keeping it simple but impactful!

        ðŸŒª What is Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)?
        
        IPV refers to abuse or aggression by a current or former partner or spouse. It can happen to anyone, but women are disproportionately affected. It includes:
        
        Physical violence: Hitting, slapping, strangling, etc.
        
        Sexual violence: Forced sex or sexual acts without consent.
        
        Emotional abuse: Insults, threats, humiliation, or controlling behavior.
        
        Economic abuse: Controlling finances, restricting access to money, or employment sabotage.

        ðŸ”¥ How does IPV start? (Early Signs)
        
        IPV rarely starts with physical violence â€” it often builds up over time. The early signs include:
        
        1. Jealousy and Possessiveness: Over-monitoring, constant calls, or isolation from friends and family.
        
        
        2. Controlling Behavior: Deciding what the partner wears, does, or says.
        
        
        3. Verbal Abuse: Name-calling, belittling, or making the partner feel worthless.
        
        
        4. Threats: Threatening to hurt themselves, the partner, or their loved ones.

        Create a plan for leaving safely â€” having money, important documents, and essentials ready.
        
        
        
        3. Law Enforcement:
        
        Report to the police if safe to do so.
        
        Involve legal aid for protection orders or restraining orders.
